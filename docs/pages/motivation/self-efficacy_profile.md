The scenario below explores the self-efficacy profile of a college student, Maria. Below you can read about Maria’s performance in her writing class, and how her self-efficacy improves by using SRL survey resources and recommendations. As you read both of these scenarios, notice how Maria’s experiences change as she begins to use the SRL survey recommended strategies to improve self-efficacy.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle">
Maria is a 43-year-old female who has been enrolled in an online college a year. Maria is a single mother of two children (ages 13 and 15 years old). Maria takes one class per semester while working as an administrative assistant. Maria gets home from work at 4:00 pm but from 4:30 pm - 7:30 pm she is responsible for picking her children up from their extracurricular activities at various times. Maria tries to use her time wisely and tries to complete school work while waiting for her children. However, she often finds herself distracted. Every other weekend Maria has the house to herself, as the children's father takes the children. During these few days, Maria tries to get as much work done as possible. </i>

**Before** receiving SRL feedback – Maria had  **LOW** self-efficacy:

<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 40px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Maria has been putting off her college writing course requirement for as long as possible, and was forced to enroll in the online version this semester. Maria took an online course last year and did not perform well. Maria had difficulty understanding the material and assignments and she often thought, “This is too hard, I can’t do this! I don’t understand this online course work and I never have time to finish my work!” Now that Maria is forced to take online writing courses, she feels uncertain about her ability to succeed. </div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Maria doubts her abilities and discourages herself by engaging in negative self-talk. Think about how this would look if Maria tried using the strategy Positive Self Talk. 
</blockquote></div>
<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 50px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Additionally, Maria is concerned with her writing ability. She has previously received poor grades on papers even when she thought she had done well. Between the frustration with her writing ability and uncertainty about online learning, Maria begins the online writing course thinking “this is going to be so hard, why bother?” </div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Maria is looking at the overall picture of her poor grades on papers, leading her to believe she won’t do well. It might be helpful if she used the strategy of Separating Feedback into Components.
</blockquote></div>
<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 50px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Throughout the course, Maria would often give up quickly when she got stuck on assignments. She also often felt frustrated when experiencing difficulty, and avoided extra credit assignments that could improve her grade – she thought she could not do them anyway so why bother. </div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Maria doesn’t understand the material and gives up quickly. Her experience might change if she were to use strategies like Break Down the Task, Develop a Growth Mindset, and Seek Help.
</blockquote></div>


 
 **AFTER** receiving SRL feedback – Maria had **MEDIUM** self-efficacy:
 
 <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 20px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
After taking the survey, Maria realized that her beliefs about her ability to learn in an online environment (her self-efficacy) were very negative. Maria decided to try to use some of the recommended strategies to improve her self-efficacy. Before her next paper was due, Maria decided to change her negative thinking into positive thoughts; instead of thinking “This is going to be too hard, I don’t care how I do,” she decided to think, “I can do this; it’s not impossible. I’m going to successfully complete this paper!” </div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Maria realized that she could start changing some things, and told herself *“This is all a process; it won’t change all at once.” 
</blockquote></div>
 
 <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 50px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
After changing her some of her thinking, she thought more about her writing skills and realized she had received some positive feedback about certain aspects of her writing. She began to write down all of the positive things about her writing. She also realized that she typically performed better on papers where she first had to write an outline. For her next essay, she decided to draft an outline and share it with her teacher. Her teacher verified that she was on the right track and gave her some writing tips, which increased Maria’s confidence that she could successfully write the paper. </div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Maria used SRL survey recommended strategies and began having greater success. Review and Record outcomes helped Maria identify the positive aspects in her writing. She took time to Learn Strategies to Use when writing the paper, beginning with an outline. She tried to Practice and Get Feedback (writing an outline and sharing with her teacher). 
</blockquote></div>

<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 30px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
While writing the paper, Maria continued to hit obstacles and sometimes felt as though she wanted to give up; she would say “I knew this would be too hard, it’s just like last time!” However, when Maria felt unsure of herself and her abilities, she used positive self-talk to remind herself of how far she had come since beginning the assignment. These self-statements also helped her focus on doing well in the class. </div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Maria continued to face challenges. Sometimes she would continue to engage in negative self-talk: “…I can’t do this!” Other times she would Use Positive Self Talk as a way to encourage and motivate herself. 
</blockquote></div>

<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 30px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Throughout the course, Maria began to feel less frustrated and more prepared to tackle new writing assignments. Even though she would occasionally doubt her abilities, Maria felt she did not need to avoid writing. assignments or online courses in the future. </div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Maria can continue to use the recommendations and find new ways to improve her self-efficacy.

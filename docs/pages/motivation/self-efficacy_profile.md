The scenario below explores the self-efficacy profile of a college student, Allison. Click on the statements below to read about Allison’s performance in her writing class, and how her self-efficacy improves by using SRL survey resources and recommendations. As you read both of these scenarios, notice how Allison’s experiences change as she begins to use the SRL survey recommended strategies to improve self-efficacy.

**BEFORE** receiving SRL feedback – Alison had **LOW** self-efficacy:

         <br>
         <p>Allison has been putting off her college writing course requirement for as long as possible, and was forced to enroll in the online version this semester. Allison took an online course last year and did not perform well. Allison had difficulty understanding the material and assignments and she often thought, “This is too hard, I can’t do this! I don’t understand this online course work and I never have time to finish my work!” Now that Alison is forced to take online writing courses, she feels uncertain about her ability to succeed. </p>

         <p>Additionally, Allison is concerned with her writing ability. She has previously received poor grades on papers even when she thought she had done well. Between the frustration with her writing ability and uncertainty about online learning, Allison begins the online writing course thinking “this is going to be so hard, why bother?” </p>

         <p>Throughout the course, Allison would often give up quickly when she got stuck on assignments. She also often felt frustrated when experiencing difficulty, and avoided extra credit assignments that could improve her grade – she thought she could not do them anyway so why bother. </p>

**AFTER** receiving SRL feedback – Alison had **MEDIUM** self-efficacy:

         <br>
         <br>
         <p>After taking the survey, Allison realized that her beliefs about her ability to learn in an online environment (her self-efficacy) were very negative. **Allison decided to try to use some of the recommended strategies to improve her self-efficacy.**  Before her next paper was due, Allison decided to change her negative thinking into positive thoughts; instead of thinking “This is going to be too hard, I don’t care how I do,” she decided to think, “I can do this; it’s not impossible. I’m going to successfully complete this paper!” </p>

         <br>
         <br>
         <p>After changing her some of her thinking, she thought more about her writing skills and realized she had received some positive feedback about certain aspects of her writing. She began to write down all of the positive things about her writing.  She also realized that she typically performed better on papers where she first had to write an outline. For her next essay, she decided to draft an outline and share it with her teacher. Her teacher verified that she was on the right track and gave her some writing tips, which increased Allison’s confidence that she could successfully write the paper. </p>

         <p>While writing the paper, Allison continued to hit obstacles and sometimes felt as though she wanted to give up; she would say “I knew this would be too hard, it’s just like last time!” However, when Allison felt unsure of herself and her abilities, she used positive self-talk to remind herself of how far she had come since beginning the assignment. These self-statements also helped her focus on doing well in the class. </p>

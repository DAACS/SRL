## ***BEFORE*** ***George began using SRL resources and recommendations -***
***High Test Anxiety:***

During math class, George learned that the professor was going to administer an exam in two weeks. George instantly got nervous and believed he was going to fail. He avoided studying until the day before the exam. When he finally began to study, George tried completing practice problems but kept getting answers wrong. His confidence was shaken and he began to second-guess himself. Because he was overcome with fear that he might fail yet again, George felt paralyzed even though he knew he should keep studying.

During the exam, George got nervous because his mind went blank. He found it difficult to concentrate on the exam as *his mind wandered about college not being worth it.*

After George finished the exam, he looked at his notes and realized that he performed some of the problems incorrectly. George had a recurrent thought that he could have done better on the exam and worried that he failed. He said to himself, “I knew that answer! How could I have gotten these questions wrong? I’ll never pass this class.”

## **AFTER** George began using SRL resources and recommendations -

***Medium Test Anxiety:***

Luckily, George took the SRL survey. After talking with his DAACS advisor, he received some advice to look through Test Anxiety section. Gradually, George began to realize that his *excessive worry and fear of failure* was probably a major reason why he has not improved in school. He began to search for some strategies or ideas about how he could lessen his anxiety.



As the semester continued, George continued to access recommendations and strategies for Test Anxiety on the DAACS website. When George encountered other exams, instead of falling back into patterns of worry, quitting, and under-performing, he focused on using **one or two of the recommended strategies.** He seemed to like the idea of working with a study group and practicing some relaxation/breathing techniques. He remembered from the SRL survey that focusing on his breathing for 5 minutes everyday can help to calm his mind and body.



During a future exam George felt that his mind was going blank. Unlike in the past, however, George was aware of the negative thoughts and feelings he was having. He told himself, “Just relax. Take a breath. You can do this.”  **He also decided to skip the difficult questions and come back to them later.** As he completed some of the problems correctly, his mind calmed down a bit and he felt more at ease. He then focused his attention on addressing the few problems that were difficult for him.

The scenario below explores the test anxiety of a fictional college student, George. Read below about how George's test anxiety impacted his academic performance. As you read both of these scenarios, notice how George's experiences change as a result of using the SRL survey recommendations to reduce his test anxiety. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle">
George is a 37-year-old male who has been enrolled in an online college for 8 months. George takes classes part-time while working a high stress job in marketing. George lives by himself in a one-bedroom apartment that is part of a larger apartment complex. The apartment complex is near a major university and therefore is filled with college students who are up all night and constantly make noise. George gets home at 5:00 pm every day, but often finds it difficult to focus on his school work due to the amount of noise within the apartment building. After about two hours of figuring out ways to block out or ignore the noise, George finds himself frazzled and nervous that his studying efforts may not be enough.</i> </div>

**Before** George began using SRL resources and recommendations – George had **HIGH** test anxiety:

<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 100px">
During math class, George learned that the professor was going to administer an exam in two weeks. George instantly got nervous and believed he was going to fail. He avoided studying until the day before the exam. When he finally began to study, George tried completing practice problems but kept getting answers wrong. His confidence was shaken and he began to second-guess himself. Because he was overcome with fear that he might fail yet again, George felt paralyzed even though he knew he should keep studying.

George instantly got nervous at the mention of an exam and engaged in irrational thinking. Studying and focusing became difficult. How would things look if George Learned and Practiced Study Stragegies or Practiced Relaxation Techniques?

During the exam, George got nervous because his mind went blank. He found it difficult to concentrate on the exam as his mind wandered about college not being worth it.

George continues to question his abilities. What if George used Positive Self-Talk?

<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 50px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
After George finished the exam, he looked at his notes and realized that he performed some of the problems incorrectly. George had a recurrent thought that he could have done better on the exam and worried that he failed. He said to himself, “I knew that answer! How could I have gotten these questions wrong? I’ll never pass this class.”

George reflects on his exam, but doesn't use this information in a useful way. He engages in irrational thinking. What if he used the strategy Review and Adapt Learning Techniques?
</blockquote></div>


**AFTER** using SRL resources and recommendations - George had **MEDIUM** test anxiety:

<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 20px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Luckily, George took the SRL survey. After talking with his advisor, he received some advice to look through Test Anxiety section. Gradually, George began to realize that his excessive worry and fear of failure was probably a major reason why he has not improved in school. He began to search for some strategies or ideas about how he could lessen his anxiety.
</div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
George sought help from his advisor and became aware of his test anxiety.

As the semester continued, George continued to access recommendations and strategies for Test Anxiety on the DAACS website. When George encountered other exams, instead of falling back into patterns of worry, quitting, and under-performing, he focused on using one or two of the recommended strategies. He seemed to like the idea of working with a study group and practicing some relaxation/breathing techniques. He remembered from the SRL survey that focusing on his breathing for 5 minutes everyday can help to calm his mind and body.

George learned that he could lower his test anxiety using different strategies. George tried to Seek Help and used Relaxation/breathing techniques.

During a future exam George felt that his mind was going blank. Unlike in the past, however, George was aware of the negative thoughts and feelings he was having. He told himself, “Just relax. Take a breath. You can do this.” He also decided to skip the difficult questions and come back to them later. As he completed some of the problems correctly, his mind calmed down a bit and he felt more at ease. He then focused his attention on addressing the few problems that were difficult for him.

George became aware of his negative thinking and Used Positive Self Talk. He also Developed Good Test Taking Skills which helped him reduce his anxiety during tests.

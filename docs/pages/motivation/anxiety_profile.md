Instead of falling back into patterns of worry, quitting, and under-performing, however, **George focused on using one or two of the recommended strategies.** He seemed to like the idea of working with a study group and practicing some relaxation/breathing techniques.

Take a breath. You can do this.” **He also decided to skip the difficult questions and come back to them later.** As he completed some of the problems correctly, his mind calmed down a bit and he felt more at ease. He then focused his attention on addressing the few problems that were difficult for him.

## What is Self-Efficacy? 

Self-efficacy simply refers to is a person’s beliefs in his or her ability to do something – it involves how confident that person is in being able to perform well or to exhibit certain behaviors. Students have self-efficacy for many different things like studying, writing an essay, performing mathematics problems and many other academic tasks. Read below about what Maria’s low self-efficacy for online learning looks like:

> Maria, a first year college student, was hesitant about enrolling in an online biology course. Although she possesses strong self-efficacy for reading, she was afraid that she wouldn’t understand the biology concepts without meeting face to face with an instructor to explain things – science had never been her strongest subject. The first class module was difficult for Maria, and she had a hard time understanding the topic. “I may as well give up now,” she thought, “Maybe this was a mistake.”

You can interpret the feedback about your self-efficacy in the following
way:

* ***HIGH*** – your confidence or belief in your ability to learn and to display effective behaviors in an online environment is strong

* ***MEDIUM*** - you likely have some confidence in these abilities, or your confidence varies across the different items

* ***LOW*** – you do not have much confidence in your ability to learn in an online context; you may have a lot of self-doubt

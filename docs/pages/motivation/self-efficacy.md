Self-efficacy refers to beliefs about one’s own ability or competency to do something. It involves levels of confidence to do specific things or the belief that one can perform well. The interesting thing about self-efficacy is that is it can vary across different courses and learning activities. For example, it would not be surprising to see that your self-efficacy for studying, writing an essay, or performing mathematics problems were very different. The DAACS SRL survey looked at a particular aspect of your self-efficacy – that is, how confident you are to learn and succeed when taking classes in an online environment. Thus, the information provided in this section is tailored to **self-efficacy for online learning,** but the principles we share are applicable to most other activities! 

To learn more about your self-efficacy for online learning, we encourage you to take the SRL survey by clicking here ***link to daacs.net***.

## WHY is self-efficacy important?

Learners with high self-efficacy for online learning are more likely to:
- persist through challenges
- engage more easily in school-related assignments and activities
- experience greater satisfaction and enjoyment when learning

On the contrary, learners who have low self-efficacy will often:
- avoid online and/or challenging work
- give up quickly when facing difficulties
- be hesitant to take certain classes or to think about dropping out of school 

The scenario below illustrates some of these potential problems that may arise when learners do not have a high self-efficacy for online learning: 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
Maria, a first year college student, was hesitant about enrolling in an online biology course. Although she possesses strong self-efficacy for reading, she was afraid that she wouldn’t understand the biology concepts without meeting face to face with an instructor to explain things – science had never been her strongest subject. The first class module was difficult for Maria, and she had a hard time understanding the topic. “I may as well give up now,” she thought, “Maybe coming back to school was a mistake.”
</div>

**Key Thought:** Students like Maria have many self-doubts when learning, which can cause them to give up prematurely and to avoid things. The key things that Maria needs are opportunities to practice working online so that she can experience some success. As students become more confident, they tend to try harder, persist longer, and perform better in school.

## HOW can I improve my self-efficacy?

Having low self-efficacy is not ideal–but it is not something to feel badly about. These beliefs can be changed and are under your control. To learn more about self-efficacy and different ways to enhance it, click on the **Learn, See,** and/or **Do** buttons.

The scenario below explores the mindset profile of a fictional college student, Omar. You can read about how Omar’s performance and behaviors in his science class varied based on the type of mindset he exhibited. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle">
Omar is a 45 year old male who enrolled in an online college five months ago. Omar is married, has a 5 year old son, and his wife is due with his second child in four months. As a security guard, Omar works the night shift, and gets home at 7 am.  Omar likes succeeding at tasks, whether it’s doing something for his family, work related, or school related. As things around the house are becoming more stressful with his job and growing family, motivation is an area in which Omar is struggling. </i>

**Before** receiving SRL feedback – Omar used a  **FIXED** mindset:

<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 100px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Omar recently took his midterm exam in his science class; he thought the exam was challenging but that he did alright. When Omar received a very poor grade on the midterm, he was quick to label himself as “bad at science” and “a failure.”
</div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Omar responds to his poor grade with a Fixed mindset. Think about how things might change for Omar if he adjusted his internal monologue to reflect a growth mindset.
</blockquote></div>
<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 50px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Omar decided he did not have the knowledge or ability to do well on the upcoming final, and thought that no amount of effort and practice could change that.
</div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Omar should be aware that his Fixed mindset is influencing his reactions.
</blockquote></div>
<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 50px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Omar continued to attend class, but became less motivated to pay attention and more withdrawn from the course. Because of Omar’s lack of motivation, he did not use effective learning strategies to study for the final. Instead, he only aimed for a passing grade on the exam, and did not care if he retained the information, regardless of whether or not it would benefit him in future classes. By the end of the course, Omar felt frustrated, defeated, and was debating whether he had the ability to do well in school.
</div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Notice how Omar's belief that his ability will not change led him to ponder whether he should drop out. What would happen if Omar exhibited a Growth mindset? Would he value the information he learned?
</blockquote></div>


 
 **AFTER** receiving SRL feedback – Omar began to adopt a **GROWTH** mindset:
 
 <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 20px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Rewind to the moment after Omar received his poor midterm grade, when he started to give up because he must be “bad at science.” Because Omar realized that the SRL survey feedback was helpful in improving his strategic behaviors, he began looking at the Mindset feedback. He was shocked to learn that he was someone who has typically displayed a Fixed Mindset. But he wanted to change that: “Because I have done well in school at certain times, maybe I do have the ability – I just have not been that “intelligent” in how I prepared for the exam.  I only studied the night before the exam and didn’t get much sleep. If I can change how I prepare, maybe I can do better.”
</div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
In reading the feedback, Omar became aware of his Fixed mindset. He then reframed the failure in terms of factors that he can control, which helped him to see how he can improve. 
</blockquote></div>
 
 <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 30px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Omar continued to attend class, but occasionally found himself thinking he was “just not capable of doing well in science” and that “no matter how hard I try, I just can’t learn this material.” Omar told himself he needed to use a Growth mindset, and thought, “with some effort and practice I can learn this material and do well in science. I must be intelligent to get to where I am today.” He also used more positive learning strategies when studying for the final, and felt a newfound sense of confidence in his ability to succeed in future science classes.
</div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Omar became aware of when he was using a Fixed mindset and adjusted his internal monologue. This allowed him to think more about using learning strategies.

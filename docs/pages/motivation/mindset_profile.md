The scenario below explores the mindset profile of a fictional college student, Ben. Click on the statements below to read about how Ben’s performance and behaviors in his science class varied based on the type of mindset he exhibited. 
 

**Before** receiving SRL feedback – Ben used a  **FIXED** mindset:

<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 100px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Ben recently took his midterm exam in his science class; he thought the exam was challenging but that he did alright. When Ben received a very poor grade on the midterm, he was quick to label himself as “bad at science” and “a failure.”
</div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Ben responds to his poor grade with a Fixed mindset. Think about how things might change for Ben if he adjusted his internal monologue to reflect a growth mindset.
</blockquote></div>
<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 50px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Ben decided he did not have the knowledge or ability to do well on the upcoming final, and thought that no amount of effort and practice could change that.
</div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Ben should be aware that his Fixed mindset is influencing his reactions.
</blockquote></div>
<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 50px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Ben continued to attend class, but became less motivated to pay attention and more withdrawn from the course. Because of Ben’s lack of motivation, he did not use effective learning strategies to study for the final. Instead, he only aimed for a passing grade on the exam, and did not care if he retained the information, regardless of whether or not it would benefit him in future classes. By the end of the course, Ben felt frustrated, defeated, and was debating whether he had the ability to do well in school.
</div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Notice how Ben's belief that his ability will not change led him to ponder whether he should drop out. What would happen if Ben exhibited a Growth mindset? Would he value the information he learned?
</blockquote></div>


 
 **AFTER** receiving SRL feedback – Ben began to adopt a **GROWTH** mindset:
 
 <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 20px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Rewind to the moment after Ben received his poor midterm grade, when he started to give up because he must be “bad at science.” Because Ben realized that the SRL survey feedback was helpful in improving his strategic behaviors, he began looking at the Mindset feedback. He was shocked to learn that he was someone who has typically displayed a Fixed Mindset. But he wanted to change that: “Because I have done well in school at certain times, maybe I do have the ability – I just have not been that “intelligent” in how I prepared for the exam.  I only studied the night before the exam and didn’t get much sleep. If I can change how I prepare, maybe I can do better.”
</div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
In reading the feedback, Ben became aware of his Fixed mindset. He then reframed the failure in terms of factors that he can control, which helped him to see how he can improve. 
</blockquote></div>
 
 <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 30px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Ben continued to attend class, but occasionally found himself thinking he was “just not capable of doing well in science” and that “no matter how hard I try, I just can’t learn this material.” Ben told himself he needed to use a Growth mindset, and thought, “with some effort and practice I can learn this material and do well in science. I must be intelligent to get to where I am today.” He also used more positive learning strategies when studying for the final, and felt a newfound sense of confidence in his ability to succeed in future science classes.

Ben became aware of when he was using a Fixed mindset and adjusted his internal monologue. This allowed him to think more about using learning strategies.

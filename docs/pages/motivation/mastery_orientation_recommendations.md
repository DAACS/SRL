<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="make" style="background-color:DodgerBlue; width:100%; font-size:20px"><b>Make learning relevant</b></button>

<div id="make" class="collapse">
Whenever you are assigned a project or some type of learning activity, think about how it is relevant to your career, your goals, or your life. Focusing on the relevance of the work will help you enjoy the process of learning, because you will care about knowing the material or mastering the skills.
<br>
<br>
<i>Before beginning a learning task, ask yourself: “How is this task relevant to me?”  Are you practicing skills that you will need in a future job? Are you learning material that is relevant to your career?</i>

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#develop" style="background-color:DarkTurquoise; width:100%; font-size:20px"><b>Develop a Growth Mindset</b></button>

<div id="develop" class="collapse">
A growth mindset is the belief that intelligence can improve with effort. Adopting this type of mindset will help you focus your effort on gaining skills and knowledge instead of focusing only on displaying the abilities you already have.

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#seek" style="background-color:MediumSpringGreen; width:100%; font-size:20px"><b>Seek Help</b></button>

<div id="seek" class="collapse">
Learners with a “performance goal” way of thinking are often hesitant to seek help because they do not want to appear inferior or dumb. Although it may be hard at first, encourage yourself to seek help when you need it. Remember, asking for help is not a sign of weakness – it is a sign that you are using good strategies to improve your learning.
<br>
<br>
Some tips for seeking help:
<ol>
<li>Identify who can help you: your professor, classmates, or academic advisor. Decide whether to approach them in person or through another method, like email.</li>
<li>Write down specific questions to ask so that you will feel prepared when approaching someone for help.</li>
<li>Find out if there are additional ways to get help. Does your college have a learning center? Are there online forums where you can post questions?</li>
</ol>

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#reframe" style="background-color:LimeGreen; width:100%; font-size:20px"><b>Reframe failures and mistakes</b></button>

<div id="reframe" class="collapse">
When facing difficulties or failure, think about how that challenge is actually an OPPORTUNITY– that is, a challenge can be a stepping stone for learning new things. Don’t focus on what others think or how you may appear to others; what is most important is to ask yourself, “What can I learn from this situation that will help me become better?” 
<br>
<br>
<i>Suppose you misunderstood a concept in a reading and posted a comment in an online discussion forum that you later realized might have sounded a bit silly. Instead of worrying, “My classmates will think I’m dumb,” reflect on how you can learn from the experience. “I really want to know these concepts well. Maybe next time I’ll do some extra research on the internet before posting my comment to make sure I really understood what I read.”</i>

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#choose" style="background-color:Lime; width:100%; font-size:20px"><b>Choose challenging tasks</b></button>

<div id="choose" class="collapse">
Learners with a Performance Goal Orientation often choose easy, non-challenging tasks because they don’t want to risk failing or appearing incompetent. However, choosing challenging tasks is important because it allows you to learn more and boost your self-efficacy when you succeed. Remember, you can only become high skilled if you take on challenging things. So the next time a challenge comes your way, embrace it and remind yourself that it is through striving to overcome challenges that you will become a stronger student.

<br>
<i>Sue’s philosophy professor requires students to choose one article a week from a list of recommended readings to read and summarize. Sue used to scroll through a few articles and pick the shortest one, because she knew it would be easier to write a good summary of a short article. Sue realizes that she’s not learning more about topics that are relevant to her interests because she is only worried about writing a “good” summary. This week, she tried something new: she chose an article on a topic that she liked even thought it was length and very detailed. After reading the article, she felt proud and satisfied because she actually learned a couple of key points that related to her career.</i>

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#focus" style="background-color:GreenYellow; width:100%; font-size:20px"><b>Focus on your individual improvement, learning, progress, and mastery</b></button>

<div id="focus" class="collapse">
You can do this by:
<ul>
<li>Setting goals and timelines for your own progress</li>
<li>Looking at improvement from your previous work</li>
<li>Rewarding yourself for your own progress</li>
</ul>
<br>
These strategies will help you focus on the process of <i>your</i> learning, instead of comparing yourself to others.
<br>
<br>
<i>If you are struggling to get good grades on online quizzes, set a personal goal (“I want to get B’s by the end of the semester.”) Focus on your individual improvement; for example, you can graph your quiz grades to create a visual representation of your progress. Reward yourself when you reach your goal. Remember, this is about you, not about how anyone else in the class is performing.</i>

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#evaluate" style="background-color:Yellow; width:100%; font-size:20px"><b>Evaluate your performance based on task criteria</b></button>

<div id="evaluate" class="collapse">
There are different ways you can evaluate a grade that you receive on a test, project, or assignment. Learners with a Performance Orientation tend to compare themselves to others. For example, they might want to know if their grade or score was higher than the class average. Instead of using class average as the your “benchmark of success”, use other things such as how well you performed the different skills for that task. It is most important to focus on making progress and mastering skills than simply outperforming others.
<br>
<br>
For example:
<br>
<br>
<i>*You scored a 78 on an exam. Reflect on your grade by asking yourself: Which material on the exam did I know well? Which questions did I get wrong? Did I misunderstand a concept or topic that I should review again?*</i>
<br>
<br>
<i>*You received a B+ grade on an essay. Think: What did I do well on this essay? Did I include the right content? Was my word usage/grammar/sentence structure correct? What can I improve for the next essay I write?*</i>
<br>

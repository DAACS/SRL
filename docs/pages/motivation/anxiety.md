**WHAT is Test Anxiety?**

<center><img src='images/TestAnxiety1.png' alt='test anxiety' /></center>

Test Anxiety is not just about tests. It represents an experience of *negative thoughts* (worries and fears) *uncomfortable and unpleasant feelings* (anxiety) and *undesirable physiological responses* (increased heart rate) when people are evaluated in some way. When people experience **high anxiety,** they tend to worry a lot about failing or being evaluated poorly. They also may frequently feel “on edge” and as a result may avoid activities, such as completing homework or studying. Learners who experience high levels of anxiety may demonstrate diminished confidence in their ability to successfully complete an exam and may excessively worry about their performance. These reactions tend to negatively influence their learning on tests or other projects.

Alternatively, learners with **low anxiety** may demonstrate confidence in their ability to complete a test. While they may feel nervous about a test, they do not let this affect their performance because they can effectively manage and control these feelings.

**WHY is test anxiety important?**
Managing anxiety in school is important because it can affect students’ overall motivation to learn as well as the quality of their engagement in school. By maintaining a low level of anxiety, it is likely that you will:

- feel at ease before, during, and after the exams and other assignments
- remain focused when challenged during learning or some type of evaluation
- use higher quality strategies to learn and perform 
- demonstrate confidence in your ability to succeed 


> *Sal, a second year college student, was feeling extremely nervous about failing his math exam. At the mention of any exam, Sal immediately begins to have negative thoughts -- he believes he’s going to fail, and often questions his ability to pass the exam and class. Sal worries so much that he often finds it difficult to not only concentrate on the exam, but to complete homework and classwork. As his next math test approached, he thought, “It doesn’t matter how much I study, I don’t know anything. There’s no way I’m going to pass this exam, or this class.”*

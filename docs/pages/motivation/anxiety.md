Test Anxiety is not just about tests. It represents an experience of *negative thoughts* (worries and fears) *uncomfortable and unpleasant feelings* (anxiety) and *undesirable physiological responses* (increased heart rate) when people are evaluated in some way. When people experience **high anxiety,** they tend to worry a lot about failing or being evaluated poorly. They also may frequently feel “on edge” and as a result may avoid activities, such as completing homework or studying. Learners who experience high levels of anxiety may demonstrate diminished confidence in their ability to successfully complete an exam and may excessively worry about their performance. These reactions tend to negatively influence their learning on tests or other projects.

Alternatively, learners with **low anxiety** may demonstrate confidence in their ability to complete a test. While they may feel nervous about a test, they do not let this affect their performance because they can effectively manage and control these feelings.

## WHY is test anxiety important?

Managing anxiety in school is important because it can affect students’ overall motivation to learn as well as the quality of their engagement in school. By maintaining a low level of anxiety, it is likely that you will:

- feel at ease before, during, and after the exams and other assignments
- remain focused when challenged during learning or some type of evaluation
- use higher quality strategies to learn and perform 
- demonstrate confidence in your ability to succeed 

When you experience **high levels of anxiety,** you are likely to:

- feel stressed and overwhelmed every time you are evaluated 
- avoid activities related to learning (e.g., homework, class assignments, studying)
- be more likely to give up when feeling overwhelmed
- experience low self-efficacy

The scenario below illustrates how your level of anxiety has the potential to influence how you think and what you do during learning.

Sal, a second year college student, was feeling extremely nervous about failing his math exam. At the mention of any exam, Sal immediately began to have negative thoughts -- he believed he was going to fail, and often questioned his ability to pass the exam and class. Sal worried so much that he often found it difficult to not only concentrate on the exam, but to complete homework and classwork. As his next math test approached, he thought, “It doesn’t matter how much I study, I don’t know anything. There’s no way I’m going to pass this exam, or this class.”

**Key thought:** Although anxiety like Sal's can be debilitating, the good news is that there are many ways to lower anxiety about tests and other assignments and to improve performance.

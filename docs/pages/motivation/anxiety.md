**What is Test Anxiety?**

Test Anxiety represents an experience of negative thoughts (worries, fears) that typically involves uncomfortable and unpleasant feelings (anxiety) and physiological reactions (increased pulse rate). When people experience *high test* anxiety, they tend to worry a lot about failing or being evaluated poorly. They also may frequently feel “on edge” and as a result may avoid activities, such as completing homework or studying, which in turn may affect performance on evaluation activities (i.e. test or exams).

> *Sal, a second year college student, was feeling extremely nervous about failing his math exam. At the mention of any exam, Sal immediately begins to have negative thoughts -- he believes he’s going to fail, and often questions his ability to pass the exam and class. Sal worries so much that he often finds it difficult to not only concentrate on the exam, but to complete homework and classwork. As his next math test approached, he thought, “It doesn’t matter how much I study, I don’t know anything. There’s no way I’m going to pass this exam, or this class.”*

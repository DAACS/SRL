<div id="aware" class="collapse">
Try to pay attention to how you talk to yourself about your schoolwork. It is important that you recognize when you respond to school activities with a Fixed mindset or a Growth mindset. A Fixed mindset will typically prompt you to question your ability to succeed and may convince you not to try, while a Growth mindset is more oriented towards seeing the positive in all situations.
<br>
<br>
<i>When you encounter a difficult task or do not do as well on an assignment as you had hoped, pay attention to whether you exhibit Fixed mindset thoughts like, “I am not smart enough to write this essay” or “I bet everyone else in the class is more capable than me”, or whether you have thoughts that reflect a Growth mindset, “I can write this essay if I use a better strategy or make an outline first” and “I can do better if I just put in more time and effort.”</i>

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#adjust">Adjust your internal monologue</button>

<div id="adjust" class="collapse">
Replace Fixed mindset thoughts with those of a Growth mindset. Recognize that if you have Fixed Mindset thoughts, YOU CAN CHANGE THEM. In addition to trying to replace Fixed Mindset thoughts with a Growth Mindset, make sure that you remember to DO SOMETHING. That is, don’t just try to think differently – change what you do to match your new way of thinking.
<br>
<br>
<i>If you have a test coming up but you feel clueless about the material, your Fixed mindset may question if you can even learn the material at all. Replace the Fixed mindset thoughts by using a Growth mindset to tell yourself that you CAN learn the material in time for the test. You can set aside time each night to learn one topic at a time. You then can sit down and pick one topic to start studying!</i>

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#Reframe">Reframe how you think about successes and failures</button>

<div id="Reframe" class="collapse">
Think about successes and failures in terms of controllable factors – such as time, effort, and strategy use – rather than uncontrollable factors – such as your innate ability or difficulty of the task.
<br>
<br>
<i>If you did poorly on a paper, think about the factors that were under your control that may have led to that performance. Rather than thinking that the poor grade was due to your lack of writing ability, perhaps you were not prepared to write the paper because you did not create an outline or collect adequate information on the target topic. If you think of your successes and failures in terms of factors you can control, such as your preparedness, strategy use, and effort, you can more easily change or GROW these things over time.</i>

<div id="neuroplasticity" class="collapse">
The brain is like a muscle: the more you work out your brain through practice, the stronger the muscle gets, and the smarter you can become! When you learn something new, your brain forms connections, which makes your brain stronger; you are not simply born with a set amount of connections and strength of your brain. If we could not strengthen our brain, then we would not be able to learn and grow after birth!
<br>
<br>
<b>WHEN</b> you encounter a challenge, <b>THINK</b> about how you can strengthen your brain, intelligence, and abilities with practice and effort, instead of focusing on how your level of intelligence is fixed.
<br>
</div>


<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#embrace">Embrace challenge</button>

<div id="embrace" class="collapse">
People with a Fixed Mindset often stay away from challenges for fear of failure. People with a Growth Mindset embrace challenges and view them as an opportunity to learn and grow. <b>When you encounter a challenge, try to think about what you can learn from the opportunity</b>, even if you do not succeed at the task. Challenges, hard work, and mistakes will help you learn and grow more than successfully accomplishing easy tasks.

<i> Robby was assigned a large, complicated research paper for his science class. Robby had little experience writing research papers or even understanding research articles. He felt overwhelmed by the challenging assignment. Instead of fearing the task and putting in minimal effort because he LACKED smarts, Robby reminded himself that struggling on something did not mean that he was dumb. He just needed to try his hardest and figure out the best strategies to comprehend the research articles and build his writing skills. By recognizing that challenges in school are normal and expected and that they do not reflect his level of intelligence, Robby felt more motivated to put forth effort. He also soon saw that he WAS able to perform better than expected because of the increased time and effort.</i>

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#remind">Remind yourself about successful attempts to use a Growth mindset</button>

<div id="remind" class="collapse">
1.  Reflect on a time when you successfully faced a challenge that seemed impossible based on your abilities at the time.
<br>
2.  Recall what you did to overcome this challenge, and how you managed to obtain the skills or behaviors necessary to do so.

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ask">Ask for help</button>

<div id="ask" class="collapse">
Developing a growth mindset means accepting that improvement happens gradually and through hard work. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness. Rather, it is a sign that you care about your learning and want to put in the necessary effort to learn and improve your skills.

    1. Determine someone you can reach out to; your academic advisor or a professor would be a good start.
    <br>
    2. Write down questions you have to ask – if you would like help improving your mindset, you can ask about some of the other tactics listed or practice using a Growth mindset to work through some challenges you encounter.
    <br>
    3. Do not get discouraged if your advisor or professor is not open to meeting at first; be persistent and advocate for yourself.
    <br>
    4. Ask how you can contact this person in the future, in case more questions arise.

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#adopt">Adopt a Growth mindset in all aspects of your life</button>

<div id="adopt" class="collapse">
Developing a growth mindset is not simply about a particular class or situation in school. It important to embrace a Growth mindset perspective across all aspects of your life, such as your relationships, health, and work. The more you can get into the habit of thinking that your ability to do things can change and improve, the better able you will be to take on difficult challenges and feel more satisfied and happy with yourself.

Mindset refers to your beliefs about whether your intelligence is fixed or can change over time. It refers to your *beliefs* about whether your intelligence or ability can improve, but **NOT** whether you are actually smart or not. Learners who have a *Growth mindset* tend to view mistakes as a normal part of learning and want to improve as they encounter challenges. Alternatively, learners with a *Fixed mindset* typically see mistakes as reflecting low ability or intelligence – something that they cannot change or improve. As a result, they tend to avoid challenging situations and are not sure about how to move forward after making mistakes. 

If you are interested in learning more about your own mindset, we strongly encourage you to take the SRL survey by clicking here ***link to daacs.net***.

## WHY is mindset important?
Adopting a Growth mindset is important because it can affect how you view success and failure and has a major influence on whether you persist or give up when encountering a challenge. 

Adopting a Growth mindset across different topics and situations will: 

- help you to cope and directly deal with struggles and challenges in school
- enhance your desire to use learning strategies more frequently 
- feel more confident in your academic abilities, especially when challenged
- be more motivated to learn and use learning strategies 

Alternatively, a Fixed mindset can adversely affect you in school. This type of mindset may lead you to: 

- feel more anxious in school
- avoid things that are difficult or challenging
- give up when you get stuck or confused 
- have negative emotional reactions, such as feeling defeated or helpless

The scenarios below illustrate the distinctions in the experiences of students who exhibit different type of mindsets.

>***FIXED:*** *Ben recently received a poor grade on his science midterm and was quick to label himself as “bad at science” and “a failure.” Ben decided he was not capable of doing well on the final, and thought that no amount of effort and practice could change that; why would he put in the effort to study if it wouldn’t make a difference? Ben stopped paying attention in class, felt defeated, and barely studied for the final exam.*

>***GROWTH:*** *Nicole took the same science midterm also received a poor grade. Nicole thought she must not have studied well enough. Although she was disappointed with the grade, Nicole understood that she could improve her ability to learn if she put in more effort and studied the material more thoroughly. Nicole took more detailed class notes, asked questions to clarify her confusions, and studied every week using study aids to help her master the material.* 

**Key thought:** Although a fixed mindset is often a negative thing, it is important to realize that having this type of mindset is NOT fixed!! That is, you can learn how to believe and act so that your intelligence can be enhanced with effort.

## How was Mindset measured on the SRL survey?

The SRL survey measured both your Growth and Fixed mindset. You were asked to respond to the six statements. We combine your responses on the three Growth and three Fixed mindset statements to determine your Mindset profile. 

### Growth Mindset

* No matter who you are, you can significantly change your intelligence level.
* You can always greatly change how intelligent you are.
* No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always change it quite a bit.

### Fixed Mindset


* You have a certain amount of intelligence, and you can't really do much about it.
* Your intelligence is something about you that you can't change very much.
* You can learn new things, but you can't really change your basic intelligence.

Have you encountered a difficult assignment and thought, “I can’t do this, I should just give up now?” *(Self Efficacy).* Maybe, you believe that no matter what you do, you can’t change your intelligence *(Mindset).* Perhaps you find yourself trying to excel in school because you simply enjoy learning and want to become more knowledgeable *(Mastery Orientation).* Finally, have you ever been presented with a project or test and became so nervous and anxious, to the point where you froze and were unsure how to proceed? *(Test Anxiety).* Each of these beliefs or ways of thinking are linked to your **motivation,** or your desire to do something. Undertanding these different sources of motivation will help you work towards your goals and perhaps to become more successful in school. Like the figure below illustrates, however, many students exhibit strengths and weaknesses in their motivation profile.

Just remember, each of these four concepts represent *beliefs,* not actual abilities. Further, these beliefs can be changed or tweaked. A key purpose of the information presented in this motivation section is to help you learn how to improve how you think about yourself as a learner. If you would like to learn more about YOUR motivational beliefs, take the SRL survey here ***link to daacs.net website***.

## WHY is motivation important?
Many students in school believe that:
- they cannot perform well in school *(low self-efficacy)*
- they cannot change how smart they are *(fixed mindset)*
- grades are more important than the process of learning *(performance goal orientation)*
- they are overly stressed in school *(high test anxiety)* 

These types of beliefs make it extremely difficult for students to excel and perform optimally in school. When students learn how to shift these negative motivation beliefs into more positive ways of thinking, they will be much more likely to persist and display resiliency as they attempt to overcome different challenges they experience.

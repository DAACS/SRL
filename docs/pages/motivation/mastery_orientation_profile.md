The scenario below explores the goal orientation profile of a fictional college student, Janet. Click on the statements below to read about how Janet’s performance and behaviors varied based on her level of Mastery Orientation before and after using SRL feedback.

### **BEFORE** using SRL survey resources and recommendations, **Low Mastery Orientation**:

For the spring semester of her first year at college, Janet was enrolled in courses that she considered easy. She had earned A’s and B’s during the Fall semester and really wanted to maintain her GPA – thus, she didn’t want to take any challenging classes. Most of her courses were not very interesting, but Janet reminded herself that she had to continue to push through. 

> Janet focus was on high grades, so she took uninteresting but easy courses. How might her course choices be different if she was more focused on individual improvement, learning, progress, and mastery

Overall, Janet did not find the material she learned in her classes fun or interesting; she never felt the desire to study in order to master the material. Originally, Janet had thought about becoming a nurse, but now she wasn’t sure she wanted to continue with her degree. She simply did not care to learn about the material. The work was so stressful – why did she need all of this pressure? 

> Janet is not interested in mastering the course material 
How would things be different if she focused on her individual learning and improvement? Or Developed a growth mindset?

### **AFTER** using SRL survey resources and recommendations - **Medium Mastery Orientation**:

Luckily for Janet, she chose to take the SRL survey during the summer. After looking through the results, Janet decided to contact her DAACS advisor in order to gain more insight regarding strategies she could use to increase her level of Mastery Orientation. Her advisor helped Janet realized that her thinking was consistent with someone who possessed low Mastery Orientation – someone who does not seem to enjoy learning who does not view mistakes as a part of the learning process. In fact, from these advisor interactions, Janet learned that she tends to exhibit a Performance Orientation (“I am not as smart as my classmates”).

> Janet Seeks Help to change her thinking about how to focus on her individual improvement, learning, progress, and mastery

While Janet still wanted to earn good grades, she realized that her thinking needed to change. It was not essential or important that she focus her energy on outperforming others or coming across as smart. What was most important was to simply learn – to become more knowledgeable and skilled – and to enjoy the process of learning. Making mistakes are OK because they represent a natural part of the learning process. This shift in thinking prompted Janet to revisit her idea about becoming a nurse. She began to use some of the strategies and recommendations from the DAACS site for Mastery Orientation.

> Janet began to Reframe Failures and Mistakes & Make Learning Relevant as a way to increase her level of Mastery Orientation.

Janet earned a B- on one of her first Anatomy and Physiology tests and was clearly discouraged. However, she felt that she learned more than what she actually showed on the test. She thought to herself, “I still want to earn at least a B+ in this course because grades matter. However, what is most important is to improve and to simply focus on learning and mastering all the concepts.” This was the first time in a long while that she was actually enjoying school.

> Janet continued to use various SRL strategies and recommendations in order to increase her level of Mastery Orientation

## Why is it important to have a Growth mindset?

Improving your mindset is crucial for improving your academic achievement. When students exhibit a Fixed mindset tend to get anxious in school a lot and will often avoid things that are very difficult. They are also likely to give up when they struggle. But mindsets can change!

If you exhibited a Fixed Mindset, we encourage you to learn how to adopt a more Growth mindset. Learners with a Growth mindset tend to deal with failure and struggles in a much more effective way. They realize that gaining knowledge or skills is often more important than achieving good grades. They also tend to be more strategic and are more likely to take on difficult tasks and challenges than people who do not have a Growth Mindset.

The following figure tells you what it means to have a FIXED, MIXED, or GROWTH mindset.

As you look at this figure, try to take note of what this might mean to you as a student.

## WHAT is time management?

<center><img src='images/LSManagingTime.JPG' alt='Managing Time' /></center>

**Time management** is an important learning strategy linked to academic success. Time management involves planning your time. It could include things like setting aside time based on due dates for an assignment, estimating how long it might take to study or complete a project, and prioritizing schoolwork. It is very common for learners to use calendars or some other scheduling tool to do all of these things. People who frequently manage their time will likely set aside regular times for schoolwork, mark down due dates on a calendar, and keep track of how long assignments take to complete. 

Learners may vary in how frequently they plan and manage their time. If you are interested in learning more about your time management skills, we strongly encourage you to take the SRL survey by going to demo.daacs.net.

## WHY is time management important?
By staying on top of managing your time for your schoolwork, you are much more likely to:
* work efficiently and productively
* complete assignments on time
* experience increased confidence in your abilities (i.e., self-efficacy)
* have more time to do leisure activities that you enjoy 
* be more relaxed and calm about your work

However, if you struggle with time management, you may:
* fall short of accomplishing your goals
* miss out on other, more enjoyable activities
* have to cram all of your study material into one long session at the last minute
* feel frustrated and stressed about being unprepared

The scenario below illustrates some of these potential problems that may arise when learners do not manage their time:
> Sam, a second year college student, performs well in some classes but not in others. He tends to struggle most in classes that involve very unfamiliar information or when there are a lot of different assignments to complete. This semester, Sam was required to enroll in a college math course that covered material that was new to him. With the first exam of the semester approaching in one week, Sam reminded himself that he needed to study this new material. He sat down to study, but soon received a text from his friends inviting him to play basketball. Since the exam was a week away, Sam figured that he could play basketball that night and could study later; after all, it was important to stay in touch with friends and get exercise, too. As the week progressed, Sam got involved with assignments for other classes and more basketball games, and neglected to study for the math exam until two nights before the test. He decided to study each chapter that would be tested, and began to read the first one. The night before the test, Sam realized he had finished only one of the four chapters, and the only way he could cover all the material was if he stayed up all night. Sam barely slept. By morning he felt anxious, stressed, and still unprepared for the exam. He was so tired during the test that he could hardly think.

**Key Thought**: Sam realized he should have spaced out his studying over the course of the week, and set specific days and times to devote to his studies. He also knew he should use the calendar on his phone to set up daily reminders about when and what to study.

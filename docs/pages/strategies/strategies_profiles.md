The following scenario illustrates how the different types of Learning Strategies (Managing time, Managing the environment, Seeking help, Enhancing understanding and learning) with a fictional college student, Stephen. Below you can read about Stephen’s college experience in two situations.

As you read the scenario, take note of how Stephen’s experiences changed based on his strategy use for managing his distractions in the environment

Stephen is a 38-year-old male who has been enrolled at Excelsior for one semester. He typically takes two classes per semester, as he also has a full-time job and a family to care for. Stephen’s wife runs a business out of their home, which typically means that the office and living room are filled with many products and constant conversation. After Stephen completed his first semester, he felt overwhelmed with the amount of activity happening at home, which lead to him feeling distracted and unsure of his assignments for class. Stephen wanted to address these concerns early on during his second semester.</i>

**BEFORE** Stephen began using SRL resources and recommendations:

The second semester was entering its third week and Stephen already had multiple assignments to complete, including an upcoming exam in mathematics. In thinking about the prior semester, Stephen recalled that every time he tried to study or write a paper, he could not find a quiet place to work. Additionally, he often found himself stuck and unsure of the material. The problem was that he didn’t know who to turn to for help. Stephen’s feelings of frustration and anxiety overwhelmed him, so he put off beginning most tasks until two days before the assignment was due. Unfortunately, Stephen’s procrastination created even more stress because not only was he under a time crunch, he still had to deal with distractions and uncertainty about the assignment.

Stephen’s feeling of stress is linked with poor time management, use of an ineffective study location, and feeling “stuck” when needing help.

<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 150px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Stephen started to study two days before the math test because he forgot when the test was scheduled. With this limited time, he began scrambling to find a place to study at home. He followed his routine of studying by re-reading his notes and looking at sample problems. He decided to study in the home office, but his wife was constantly walking in and out, talking on the phone with her clients. Additionally, Stephen kept checking his phone for emails and text messages.

The distractions in the office and the time crunch affected Stephen’s ability to focus.

<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 50px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
As he re-read his notes, he began to get nervous because he did not remember how to complete several of the problems. He did not know whom he should ask for help. He decided that the best thing to do was to finish reading all of his notes and to makes sure he knows as much of the material as possible.  By the end of the night, Stephen felt overwhelmed, stressed, and unprepared for the test. The day of the test, Stephen couldn’t remember much of what he studied the night before. He thought to himself, “This is not good. I am going to fail!”

Stephen’s uncertainty on how to ask for help added on to his feelings of stress. He felt unfocused and underprepared for the test.

 **AFTER** Stephen began using SRL resources and recommendations:
*Partial/Emerging use of strategies:*
<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 100px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Luckily, Stephen took the SRL survey. With the advice of his advisor, Stephen began to look through the feedback section on Learning Strategies. Gradually, Stephen began to realize that his stress and lower grades were due to his use of ineffective strategies. Whether it involved managing his environment or time, asking for help, and practicing math problems, Peter began to learned many strategies that could help him to perform better. While this seemed like a lot at first, Stephen realized that these are all related and can all be addressed! He began to look through the Learning Strategies recommendations.

Stephen became aware of effective Learning Strategies.

<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 50px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
As the semester continued, Stephen encountered other tests. With the support of his advisor, he began to approach his studying as opportunities to try his newly learned strategies. Stephen started with managing his time. He knew that his next test was a week away, and scheduled study days and times throughout that week. Stephen found it difficult to follow this schedule, as something seemed to always come up last minute. Stephen decided to tell his wife that he needed some time at home that was free of distractions. He shared his study schedule with her. This helped to initiate a conversation that led to an agreement that she would not come into the office during certain times of the day or night. Stephen also decided to leave his phone in a different room, so he would not be tempted to check it.

Stephen learned how to manage his time and manage his distractions. While Stephen is showing progress, there are still some areas for improvement.  
</blockquote></div>
<div class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 50px"> <!-- Adjust the margin-top until the text displays where you want -->
Stephen also learned that there are many different ways to study; he didn’t have to simply re-read his notes. He needed to be more active. For example, he decided to use practice problems from relevant quizzes and homework and created flash cards for vocabulary terms and key points. When Stephen reached material that he was unsure of, he emailed his professor with specific questions. Stephen also used other resources (i.e. books, the internet, classmates), to try and work through the problem. While trying these new strategies, Stephen felt empowered and thought to himself, “Wow! I can see a difference already! I definitely feel more focused and I feel like I’m actually learning this material!”
</div><div class="col-md-6"><blockquote class="oval-thought">
Stephen tried different strategies for learning the material and help seeking, which in turn helped him achieve greater success.
</blockquote></div>

Stephen realized that *this was just the beginning of learning and trying new strategies*.

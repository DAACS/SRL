Some classes and topics in school can be very difficult. When learners take online classes, however, things can be even more challenging. In these learning situations, learners do not have face-to-face contact with teachers and they may not receive monitoring and feedback that is provided in other classroom contexts. Because all learners will encounter bumps in the road or will get stuck or confused at times, regardless of the type of classes they take, it is imperative that they feel confident and skilled to ask for help, when needed.

Learners who frequently ask for help will try to gather information about details of upcoming tests or quizzes, guidance about how to complete an assignment, or explanations about complex concepts.

In college, learners may vary in how often they ask for help or use strategies to seek help. To become more skilled in seeking out help from others we strongly encourage you to first take the SRL survey by clicking <a href="https://demo.daacs.net/">here</a>.

## WHY is help seeking important?
Consistently asking for help will increase the likelihood that you:

* complete assignments correctly
* feel more supported and, therefore, less stressed
* experience greater confidence in the quality of your schoolwork
* learn new ways to learn
* stay on track with a course’s schedule and pace

Seeking out help from others can be difficult. You may feel anxious or intimidated, or believe that you do not have the time or energy to do so. However, if you do not seek out assistance when it is really needed, you may:

* misunderstand a topic or assignment’s instructions
* learn information incorrectly, which can impact your performance in related classes
* fall behind in class
* feel lost, confused, frustrated, and/or incapable of accomplishing your goals

The scenario below illustrates some of the potential problems that may arise when learners **do not seek** help:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
Erica, a 29 year old who works as an elementary school aide, recently enrolled in an online college English course. Erica considers herself to be a smart, hardworking professional and believes she will succeed in the course without much difficulty. During the second lesson, Erica began having trouble comprehending some course material. Instead of asking for clarification, Erica tried to figure out the confusing content on her own. She thought, “I am smart enough to have made it this far, I should be able to do this. Plus, talking to teachers makes me nervous!” Erica continued to push her way through each lesson, ignoring content she did not understand. As the course continued, Erica felt overwhelmed and frustrated, and she was no longer confident in her ability to do well in the course. Of greatest concern was that, because Erica had avoided certain topics, she had difficulty understanding more advanced concepts in class, which then caused her to fall further behind in her classwork.

**Key Thought:** Erica's attitude–“I don't want to ask for help”–is fairly common among learners. But much of the frustration and anxiety that she experienced could have been avoided if she recognized that getting help from others is not an admission that she could not learn, or was dumb: Help-seeking is a hallmark of successful, self-regulated learners.

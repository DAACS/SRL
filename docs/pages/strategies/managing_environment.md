## WHAT is managing your environment?

Often we find ourselves distracted by someone or something while completing school work. Someone who uses effective strategies to manage their environment and reduce distractions will be very in tune to the things going on around them -- noise levels, lighting quality and temperature of a room, and access to games or friends. These individuals might say to themselves, “The TV is too distracting, I’m going to turn it off” or “It’s too warm in here…I feel like I’m going to fall asleep” By continually monitoring their activities and using strategies to manage the place in which they do work, learners have a much greater chance of completing their work. 
Learners may vary in how frequently they manage their environment. If you are interested in learning more about your environment management skills, we encourage you to take the SRL survey by going to demo.daacs.net.

## WHY is managing your environment important?

By frequently using strategies to manage your environment when completing schoolwork, it is likely that you will:

* be more efficient in completing schoolwork
* maintain your concentration as you do your work
* produce more high quality and accurate work 
* experience less frustration and stress

However, if you struggle to manage distractions in your environment, you may:

* feel stressed or overwhelmed because you cannot focus
* have difficulty remembering information you are trying to learn
* get agitated and frustrated from the distractions  
* give up more easily on difficult tasks

The scenario below illustrates some of the challenges that may arise when learners do not manage their environment:
> Gloria, a first year college student, was feeling stressed and overwhelmed with writing a research paper that is due in about a week. While writing the paper, Gloria had her cell phone on her desk and would continually check out the texts that here friends were sending back and forth. She also would attempt to do her work when her children or other family members were around. At one point, she stated to herself, “I am so stressed out. I just can’t seem to concentrate. I have so much to do, but I can’t seem to get anything done." Because her life was so hectic and busy, Gloria did not even have time to reflect on ways of making the situation better. Gloria was inching closer to making a decision about not continuing in college. 

**Key Thought**: Gloria did not realize that she actually had some control over this situation. The key thing for her to realize was that she could learn strategies to minimize the distractions and interruptions as she completed her work. By doing these things, she would probably have more time to study and would be able to concentrate more fully when doing her work.

Improving how much you learn and the grades you attain in school often depends on how strategic you are about managing your time or environment, asking for help, and trying to learn and remember information from your classes. The key focus of this section is providing recommendations for using four strategies needed for college success: (1) **Managing your time**, (2) **Managing your environment**, (3) **Help seeking**, and (4) **Enhancing understanding and memory**. You may already use many of these strategies, and you may find that they are all not useful to you. But it is also likely that you will find many of these recommendations useful and important. 

Please click on the strategy buttons that you think will be helpful to you. For each strategy section, we provide several examples of how you can use the strategy as you learn in college.


## Strategies to manage your TIME

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#timerec1" style="background-color:Lime; width:100%"><b>Guiding Principle 1: Start STudying/working several days in advance of due dates</b></button>

<div id="timerec1" class="collapse">
When you have a test or assignment due on a specific date, start your work multiple days ahead of time. The earlier you start your work, the more time you will have to:
<br>
- spread out your studying into manageable chunks
- deal with unexpected conflicts that may arise throughout the week, such as an unexpected doctor’s appointment or time lost to a fun activity
<br>
<br>
<i>How far in advance should you begin preparations?</i>In order to figure out how far in advance you should begin, create a timeline with a specific plan about what you will do each day. This will allow you to assess how much time everything will take, which will help you to decide on an appropriate start date. For example, if you have an English paper due in one week, you should immediately begin by first breaking up the task into smaller parts. If the paper had three unique components, you one possibility is to devote one day for each component and then having at least one day integrating, editing, and revising. Thus, if the assignment was due on March 10th, you may want to schedule the assignment as follows:
- Component 1 – March 4th
- Component 2 – March 5th 
- Component 3 – March 6th 
- Integration and Revision – March 8th
- Final touch ups – March 9th 
<br>
<i>See the <a href="http://srl.daacs.net/metacognition_planning.html">Planning page</a> for more information about planning out your assignments</i>

<div id="timerec2" class="collapse">
The brain is like a muscle: the more you work out your brain through practice, the stronger the muscle gets, and the smarter you can become! When you learn something new, your brain forms connections, which makes your brain stronger; you are not simply born with a set amount of connections and strength of your brain. If we could not strengthen our brain, then we would not be able to learn and grow after birth!

**Guiding Principle 2: Set aside regular times using a weekly calendar**

Many students often ask themselves, “When will find the time to do all of my work this week?” College life is busy and complex. To help make things more manageable, it is important to use calendars or other types of scheduling tools to plan and organize your time. For a general process to follow to organize your time using a calendar:
- Write down all upcoming assignments and their due dates 
- Write down all of the classes and non-school activities that you will be involved in during the week. 
- Identify open time blocks or “potential” spaces to do your work
- Make sure to space out work for complex assignments over several days

The figure below represents an example of what your weekly calendar might look like. Take  note of the multiple days and times set aside to complete an English paper (yellow boxes) and study for a science test (green boxes).

**Guiding Principle 3: Prioritize tasks**

It is important to note only identify the tasks you have to complete, but the importance of each of these task. 
*To prioritize different tasks you have to complete in a given week:*
1. Create a list of all of your schoolwork and assignments
2. Identify the due dates for all assignments (e.g., begin with the paper due tomorrow, rather than the discussion post due 4 days from now),
3. Identify the most important tasks that you need to accomplish
4. Identify how long you think it will take to complete each assignment (e.g., if a paper will take multiple hours, you may want to start with that paper, shift to a less intensive task, and then go back to the paper)
5. Identify the most difficult tasks to complete (e.g., start with harder tasks while you have more energy and motivation).

**Guiding Principle 4: Practice estimating the amount of time you need**

Becoming accurate in your estimation of the time needed to complete a task (e.g., writing a paper, studying) will help you to budget your time effectively. If you underestimate how long something will take (which is a very common thing to do), you may misjudge what you want need to do and then run out of time --- something that can be very frustrating! To become more accurate at estimation, look below for an example of what to do:
1. Make 3 columns on a piece of paper that you can easily and frequently access (e.g., in a planner). In the left-most column, write down a specific goal for your studying/schoolwork. For help setting goals, see the Set specific study goals strategy below. 
2. In the middle column, write how much time you think you will need to accomplish the goal.
3. After you have completed the task, record the actual amount of time you spent working in the right-most column. 

For example, your estimation log may look like this:

Compare the difference between the estimated time and actual time spent on each task to help you more accurately estimate required time in the future. If there is a difference between your estimate and the actual time, be sure toask yourself:
- Why was I so off in my estimation?
- Did something get in my way of completing it?
- What can I do differently to make sure things go more smoothly?

**Guiding Principle 5: Set specific study goals**

Instead of deciding that you need to “study for the math test”, it may be helpful to develop smaller, and more specific goals. This can focus your study time and better estimate how long it will take you to complete each goal. Try to make your goals specific, such as “(1) read math chapter six on probability, and (2) study probability terms until I can recall 90% of the terms from memory.” You can then estimate how long each goal will take (e.g., “I need one hour to read chapter six and 30 minutes to study probability terms”) and decide when you will set aside time to accomplish the tasks (e.g., “I only have an hour to work on homework tonight, so I will read chapter six tonight and set aside 30 minutes to study tomorrow night”).

**Guiding Principle 6: Break up your study/work times into small chunks**

It is helpful to your learning if you spread out your studying and assignment completion over different days and/or to take breaks when studying on a given day. Engaging in “marathon” study sessions or cramming your work into one large block of time often hinders learning. 

For example, it may be helpful to schedule tasks and create goals that will take you approximately 30 to 60 minutes to complete. For instance, it is more conducive to your motivation and learning if you set the goal of reading one book chapter in 60 minutes rather than saying that you will read 2 book chapters and answer questions in a 3 hour time block. To help you with this activity, you can use calendar to track what activities you have that day, what time you have available to study, and how you will break up your study time by task.

For more help with creating a schedule, see the strategy **Set aside regular times using a weekly calendar.**

**Guiding Principle 7: Take breaks while completing your school work**

It may sound counterintuitive, but taking breaks in between completing assignments or studying can also enhance your time management. As students get tired and fatigue from doing too much work, it is more likely that they will make mistakes and work less efficiently. Of course there may be times when you need to push through your schoolwork or to study at a slower pace, remember that taking several short breaks is a way to reenergize and refresh your mind.

**Guiding Principle 8: Alternate study topics/tasks**

When completing schoolwork or studying for a long time, it also important to consider alternating topics or tasks. For instance, you might focus on reading a book chapter for an hour, then switching to completing math problems before continuing your reading. While it might seem that finishing a reading then answering related questions on that same topic before moving onto another topics an effective way to study, you are less likely to remember the material later on.

**Guiding Principle 9: Reduce procrastination**

Procrastination in school, or delaying when you attempt to complete some task or activity, can seem like a good idea in the short-term, since it provides an immediate reward. For instance, going to a party or taking an extra shift at work gives social interaction and monetary rewards that may seem more important than doing your schoolwork in the short-term. The problem is that procrastination becomes the norm, it hinders the likelihood that you will be able to complete tasks on time. 

A first step to minimize a tendency to procrastinate, is to identify the types of things you do to procrastinate (e.g., scanning social media, watching TV, cleaning up/organizing your room). If you think about why you do these activities, it is likely that they provide you with some level of comfort or support. On the flip side, however, just remember that procrastination will often make time management a very difficult strategy to implement. 


## Strategies to manage your ENVIRONMENT
**Guiding Principle 1: Study in a quiet place with minimal distractions**

Completing schoolwork in a loud environment that includes people having conversations, the TV blaring in the background, or other distractors can make it difficult for students to focus, stay on topic, and study in an efficient manner. Find a quiet location, such as a library or quiet room in your house that is free from noise and other people. This will help reduce distractions in your environment, which will allow you to fully concentrate on the task at hand. You may believe that the TV in the background or family members talking on the side are not distracting, but you may be surprised how much more efficiently and carefully you work when you are in an environment with fewer distractions. Your mind can only process a certain amount of information before it gets distracted or overworked.

**Guiding Principle 2: Inform others around you of “do not disturb” rules**

If you live with or work around others, you may find yourself frequently being interrupted while you try to work. For instance, a family member may ask you what is for dinner or a coworker may ask you how your weekend went; while it can be important to engage in these conversations during study breaks, these frequent interruptions can interfere with completing your schoolwork. Inform others around you that you need times that involve “do not disturb.” Tell people not to disturb you:
- when you are in a specific location or work space, 
- during some times of the day 
- when they see a “do not disturb” sign on your door. 
It might also be helpful to let others know that you need a certain amount of time to study with no distractions to clarify expectations for when you will be available versus when you need quiet time. 

**Guiding Principle 3: Minimize excess technology use**

These days, everyone has easy access to their friends, family, and world at large via cell phones, social media, internet, and/or the news on the TV. Walk into almost any situation and you will see people sending text messages, engaging in phone calls, sending emails, using social media, watching TV, and playing games on their phone/computer/console, etc. We may think that our technology is not distracting, since we are so used to having it around 24/7, but turning off all forms of technology – even the WiFi on your computer when you do not need it – can put up a “privacy wall” behind which you can focus on your schoolwork. Try to get into the habit of turning off the technology that is not needed for a given assignment.

**Guiding Principle 4: Vary the places where you study**

If you get bored or tired while studying/completing schoolwork, move from one location to another to stay focused and alert. Identify 2 or 3 comfortable and quiet places where you can work, such as multiple rooms in your house, a library, an office, or a quiet coffee shop. Sometimes a change of scenery is what you mind needs to feel refreshed and rejuvenated.

**Guiding Principle 5: Find the right balance of comfort in your environment**

While studying, you shouldn’t feel uncomfortable in your environment, but you also shouldn’t be too comfortable whereby you want to take a nap; find a balance. This may involve working in a location that is neither too hot or cold, where the lighting is bright enough (but not too bright) so that you will not strain your eyes, and that involves seating that is comfortable (e.g., sitting in a cushioned chair) but not excessively so (e.g., lying on one’s bed). Find the right balance of proper lighting, comfort, and temperature for an ideal study environment. 

**Guiding Principle 6: Use various forms of sensory enhancements**

Scented candles, classical music, or white noise may help keep you relaxed and focused throughout a study session. They can provide appropriate sensory enhancements, which can make studying feel easier, without distracting you from your work. Obviously, these things only work if YOU learn that they actually help you. Different people have different ways to relax and induce relaxation. Use those that work best for you.


## Strategies to help you get the HELP you need to learn
**Guiding Principle 1: Identify the sources needed to answer your questions**

All students get confused from time to time. When you do experience a challenge, ask yourself whether the answer can be found using non-social strategies (e.g., looking up things in notes/textbooks) or if another person is needed (e.g., your teacher, classmate, advisor) for help? Be sure to try both options in order to determine which strategy typically works better for you.

**Guiding Principle 2: Identify and write down the specific things that give you trouble**

One of the challenges in getting help from your teachers, advisors, or friends is that you may not know what to ask them. One of the first steps in getting help from others is to identify the specific assignments or topics that are challenging. But make sure to be specific in recording the things that are challenging for you and list them out so that you can ask the person at one time. The more prepared you are for a help-seeking session, the more productive it will likely be.

**Guiding Principle 3: Identify how you should approach and contact your teacher/advisor**

At the start of a course, if possible, ask your teacher/advisor about the best way to contact them. You could try attending their office hours, emailing, using a mail system through a course website, or calling their phone. As part of this initial conversation, you can also problem for:
- the most appropriate time to how speak 
- their preferred method of providing feedback
- how they provide feedback about assignments or projects 
Establishing this level of contact early on in a semester can naturally open the door for future conversations.

**Guiding Principle 4: Look to classmates as another source of help**

Your classmates can be a great source of information and help throughout a course, even when you have not spoken to them in person. Try to identify two to three students in class with whom you would may want to seek out assistance. In an online learning environment, you can look for classmates who respond to discussion boards with thoughtful, comprehensive answers. You can also ask your teacher for advice about how to approach other students or if they can organize some group activities in class. After you determine who to ask for help, you can figure out appropriate ways to reach them, such as through their email, the class website, or in person during class. 

**Guiding Principle 5: Advocate for yourself**

Regardless of from whom you are trying get assistance, be persistent if your first attempt to connect does not get a response! Frequently, teachers and advisors receive so many emails that they cannot respond to all of them right way, or emails may get lost in cyber space. If you do not hear back right away, or are told that a teacher is not open to giving you extra time, do not get discouraged. For instance, if seeking help from your teacher was not successful, reach out to your advisor or another teacher you are familiar with and ask if they can help to facilitate a meeting with your teacher or provide you with other helpful resources. Highly successful students advocate for themselves and will find a way to get the information and assistance that they need.


## Strategies to improve your LEARNING and UNDERSTANDING
**Guiding Principle 1: Quiz and test yourself**

Self-testing or completing practice tests is a highly effective strategy for improving learning and performance. Try one of the following methods to check how well you understand material and decide where to focus the remainder of your study efforts (hint: you should spend more time and effort on the areas that you struggle to answer correctly when you test yourself). You should continue to test yourself until items are answered correctly more than once, preferably with a chunk of time in between study sessions. Below are a few ideas about how to self-test.
- Complete sample questions at the end of book chapters and/or online resources that accompany textbooks 
- Search for sample questions related to your topic online
- Predict test questions and then practice answering them
- Ask your teacher for practice questions/tests
- Try to reproduce your notes without looking, then check to see how well you did
- Take turns creating and responding to sample questions with a classmate; answer the question on your own before looking at your partner’s response
- Create flashcards with the question or term on one side and the answer on the other (*link to effective flashcards on Excelsior or below in this section)

**Guiding Principle 2: Spread out your studying over time**

This principle was also discussed as part of **Strategies for managing time**. Studying material across multiple days (i.e., reviewing some of the same material each day) is a highly effective way to maximize how much information you store in your memory. Sometimes you brain needs to hear the information in different ways and at different times before it truly can place it in long-term memory. This principles applies to other learning activities besides studying for tests. Thus, spreading out the time you devote to a writing assignment may also help you revise and tweak the essay more effectively than if you attempted to write in one sitting.


**Guiding Principle 3: ELABORATE on material: Explain why something is true**

Instead of simply memorizing facts, push yourself to explain why an idea or concept is true. For instance, instead of simply accepting that the sun rises in the East and sets in the West ask yourself why this is true and explain to yourself the mechanisms behind why the sun moves in a certain direction. It is only when people go beyond memorizing facts and begin to examine questions of HOW and WHY that they truly come to understand a concept. 

**Guiding Principle 4: ELABORATE on material: Relate new information to other ideas**

For information to get into your long-term memory, it is often helpful to connect new information to things that you have already mastered and learned. It is essential that you relate class information to things you already know in order to improve your level of understanding. 

**Guiding Principle 5: ELABORATE on material: Identify connection and relations**

It is essential that you understand the relationships between topics that you are learning. It is helpful to use graphic organizers, conceptual/thematic webs, and concept maps to integrate material and to understand the relationships between what you are learning. You may also want to use outlines to integrate all of your information so that it is easier to link large amounts of related information. Use graphic organizers and conceptual maps is helpful for when you study, reading information, or even write essays. 

**Guiding Principle 6: Form mental images from text**

When studying, it may help you to imagine what you are reading. Instead of just focusing on the act of reading, you should generate images in your mind that represent the content of what you are reading. This can also apply while you are in class or listening to material. For example, if you are learning about different types of habitats, it will help if you picture in your mind each habitat as you read about it. This way, you will be associating mental images with the content of the textbook and you can pull on these mental images when trying to remember what makes up different types of habitats.

**Guiding Principle 7: Talk aloud while you are reading**

Instead of reading in your head, it helps to say what you are reading out loud. This strategy applies regardless of whether you are trying to read a textbook or class notes. By reading out loud, you will be learning the information through visual and auditory modalities, which will allow you to better remember what you are learning.

**Guiding Principle 8: Take and rewrite notes**

Taking notes is an important step in learning material. When you are reading out of a textbook, for example, you should be sure to take notes on main ideas. This will allow you to conceptualize what you are reading and it also provides you with an outline to review instead of going back to the textbook to learn the material. Rewriting notes can also help to enhance clarity and the repetition will allow you to become more familiar with the topics.

**Guiding Principle 9: Make flash cards**

Use index cards in order to remember things such as facts, details, definitions, and formulas. You should write a question or key term on one side of the note card and then write an explanation on the back side of the card. In order to get the most from your flash cards, vary which side you look at first. For example, sometimes you want to be sure to look at the word and verbally say the definition that you expect to be on the other side. Other times, you should look at the definition and try to identify what vocabulary word or concept it is describing. It is essential that you use notecards repeatedly. Don’t just make them and assume that your studying is complete!

**Guiding Principle 10: Summarization**

Writing summaries is useful thing to do when reading texts or when studying. Making a summary of what you are learning can help you better understand material and to assess how much you already have retained. By writing the important points in your own words, you will also be more likely to recall the material later on. If you are unsure about how to pick out the main ideas, it would be a good idea to meet with your advisor and practice. You can read a section of the text while with your advisor and practice determining the important ideas. Because the advisor will be there, he/she can provide you with feedback about your ability to pick out the big idea in a text. 

**Guiding Principle 11: Gather detailed information about the assignment, project, or test**

To perform well on any activity, students need to have a clear idea about the demands and requirements of those activities. This might involve identifying the content, format, and length of the test. When writing essay, you may want to identify the type of essay to be completed as well as it length or other requirements. Thus, regardless of the things you are asked to do in school, make sure you have a clear sense of what is actually being asked of you.

## WHAT is planning?

<center><img src='images/Metacognition=Planning FINAL.PNG' alt='Metacognition Cycle' /></center>

Planning is one aspect of metacognition. Planning involves thinking about how you will approach a task before you begin it. For example, learners who frequently plan will ask themselves things like, “What do I already know about this task” or “What is needed to perform well on this task.” They may even think about, “What are some different ways I can complete this assignment?” Asking these types of **planning questions** is important because it often leads learners to think about strategies that are needed to succeed. For example, when studying for a test, asking yourself what you material you have not learned or mastered can lead you to identify study strategies to help you learn that material. 
In college, learners may vary in how frequently they plan. If you are interested in learning more about **your** current planning skills, we strongly encourage you to take the SRL survey by clicking here https://demo.daacs.net/.

## WHY is planning important?

Planning or thinking ahead about how best to complete your work in college will help you:
* avoid making mistakes
* complete assignments correctly and on time
* work more efficiently
* feel more relaxed (and less stressed)

However, when you **do not** think or make a plan about completing work, some problems can arise. For example, you may:

* not fully understand what is being asked of you
* underestimate how long an assignment will take, which can cause you to run out of time
* not understand the learning strategies needed to perform well

The scenario below illustrates some of these potential problems that may arise when learners do not use planning strategies:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>GROWTH:</b>
> *Sophia, a second year college student, was feeling stressed and
> overwhelmed as her math course entered its second week. Luckily,
> Sophia possesses strong time management skills. She printed her
> syllabus, took out her student planner, and highlighted due dates for
> various assignments, quizzes, and projects. Sophia then began to
> transfer these assignments to her planner, where she wrote each
> assignment on the date it was due. After completing this, Sophia then
> began to schedule time to work on each assignment, allowing herself
> enough time to complete the assignment a few days before its actual
> due date. “Wow! I have a lot of assignments for this class,” she
> thought, “It’s a good thing I’m planning the semester now. I wouldn’t
> want to fall behind.”*

**Key Thought**: Sophia's initial conversation with her advisor changed her outlook and perspective about school. He helped her realize that there was value in pausing and reflecting about an assignment for a few minutes before attempting to complete it. Having this realization naturally led Sophia to seek out additional assistance about how to become a more effective planner.

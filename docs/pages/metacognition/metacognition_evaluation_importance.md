In school, and in life, there will always be many opportunities for you
to evaluate – that is, to ask yourself how well you performed something.
For example, you may evaluate when:

* you finish reading a chapter in a textbook
* after solving a math problem as part of homework
* you receive a test grade back from a teacher

Regardless of the specific “evaluation moment”, you will be likely to repeat the same mistakes again and again if you do not have a clear and accurate sense of how you actually performed.

Becoming an effective evaluator is important and is like being “mini-detective” about schoolwork – it enables you to piece together a puzzle so that you can identify what worked, what did not work, and, hopefully, what needs to be done to improve.

## How can Evaluation influence the way you think, feel, and act?

The following figure will help you understand what it means to be a FREQUENT, PARTIAL, or INFREQUENT user of evaluation strategies. It also will give you some ideas about the typical outcomes and feelings people might experience depending on how frequently and how skilled they are in evaluating. In what ways do the following descriptions reflect you as a learner?

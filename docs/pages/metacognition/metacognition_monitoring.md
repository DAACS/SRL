### What Does a Good Monitor Do? 

Frequent monitors use strategies to build their **awareness** about
their thinking and learning so they understand and can **control** how
well they learn. While learning, good monitors might ask themselves
things like, “Do I understand what I am studying?” or “How well am I
remembering this information?” By continually coming up with answers to
these questions, good monitors are better able to reflect on how they
might need to change or adjust their approach to school.

> Jose, a third year college student, is currently enrolled in an
> online English course. There are a lot of assigned readings for the
> class, and Jose tries to get through them as quickly as he can –
> without stopping to make sure he understands what he is reading.
> Often, after reading an entire book chapter, he will think, “What did
> I just read?” By the next day, Jose has usually forgotten what he read
> the night before, but he just keeps doing the readings because he has
> so much to cover.

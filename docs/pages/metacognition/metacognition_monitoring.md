## WHAT is monitoring?

<center><img src='images/Metacognition-Monitoring FINAL.PNG' alt='Metacognition Cycle' /></center>

Monitoring is one of the three core areas of metacognition. Learners use monitoring strategies to build self-awareness and to take greater control how well they learn. Throughout your life, you will have many opportunities to monitor yourself – that is, to ‘check-in’ during a learning activity and ask yourself if you’re understanding the activity and meeting your learning goals. For example, learners can ask themselves, “Do I understand what I am studying?” or “Am I on the right track for this assignment?” By asking these types of questions, learners are encouraged to think about and reflect on strategies that work and adjust strategy use for the future.

As you can see in the figure above, learners can vary in how often they monitor their behaviors and learning in school (i.e., frequent, partial, infrequent). To learn more about **your** monitoring behaviors in school, click on the following link to take the SRL survey https://demo.daacs.net/.

## WHY is monitoring important?

By frequently monitoring how you learn and complete your schoolwork, it is likely that you will:

* become more aware of things you do well and the areas in need of improvement 
* identify things that might be causing you to struggle
* catch and correct mistakes or misunderstandings while working
* develop ideas about how to adjust your approach to a task when you get stuck

Conversely, if you **do not** self-monitor your performance or the things you do in school, you may:

* only notice mistakes **after** your teacher grades an assignment
* get stuck on a task and feel lost and confused about how to move forward
* keep making the same mistakes again and again 
* become frustrated because your effort does not lead to the results you want

The scenarios below illustrate the benefits of engaging in self-monitoring (see Sandra) along with the problems that may arise for college students when they do not self-monitor (see Jose).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> 

> *Jose, a third year college student, is currently enrolled in an online biology course. 
> There are a lot of assigned readings for the class, and Jose tries to get through them 
> as quickly as he can-–without stopping to make sure he understands what he is reading. 
> Often, after reading an entire book chapter, he will think, “What did I just read?” 
> By the next day, Jose has usually forgotten what he read the night before, but he keeps 
> doing the readings this way because he has so much to cover.*

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i>

> *Sandra, Jose's classmate, also struggles to complete all the class readings, but she 
> makes sure to pause and monitor her level of understanding of the reading. As she reads, 
> Sandra highlights a word on the page that was confusing or marks an entire paragraph 
> that was not clear. She also writes down questions after completing the reading, to remind 
> herself what she needs to ask her classmates or instructor. Tracking these types of things 
> helps to increase Sandra's confidence to learn well in the class.*

**Key Thought**: A key thing that distinguished Sandra and Jose was that Sandra spent time monitoring how she was learning. She also kept track of the things that were confusing or challenging, which helped her seek out the help she needed. Just remember that becoming a more effective monitor is something that can be learned and improved.

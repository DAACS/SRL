## WHAT is evaluation?

<center><img src='images/Evaluation Picture.dox' alt='Metacognition Cycle' /></center>

Evaluation is a very important aspect of metacognition. As a college student, there will be many opportunities for you to evaluate yourself – that is, to ask how well you performed something. When students self-evaluate their performance, they may ask themselves, “Am I learning well on this activity?” or “What things did I find challenging?” These types of questions naturally prompt students to think about the strategies that worked well for them and those that were less effective. 

## WHY is evaluation important?

Being an effective evaluator enables students to piece together a puzzle so that they can identify what worked, what did not work, and, hopefully, what needs to be done to improve for next time. By evaluating yourself more frequently, it is likely that you will:

* become more aware of your strengths and weaknesses
* identify specific skills that need to be improved
* develop an understanding of the strategies that are most effective for assignments
* feel confident in the quality of work that you submit

However, when you <u**do** **not** self-evaluate on a regular basis, some problems can arise. You may:

* not recognize the need to adapt or change how you approach a learning activity
* repeat the same mistakes on future assignments
* overestimate your skills and subsequently give less than optimal effort
* feel helpless or defeated when an assignment or test does not go the way you hoped

The scenario below illustrates some of these potential challenges that may arise when learners do not use evaluation strategies:

> *Anthony, a first-year college student, just finished taking his first
> History exam of the semester. Often after an exam Anthony thinks to
> himself, “I know how well I did on that exam; I’m content with my
> grade.” He thinks and reflects on the material he learned and is
> confident about having learned all of the necessary material. However,
> he has a set way of studying and does not think about easier or better
> ways to study for different exams and often does not reflect on what
> went well and what didn’t well with studying. Therefore, Anthony
> sometimes feels stuck or overwhelmed when beginning to study for his
> next exam, as he doesn’t really know the best way to study for an
> exam, he only knows one way.*

**Key Thought:** Anthony's experience of overestimating his learning during studying is common among college students. The key to avoiding these types of misjudgments is to remind constantly self-evaluate to obtain an accurate picture of how you perform.

## WHAT is evaluation?

<center><img src='images/Evaluation Picture.dox' alt='Metacognition Cycle' /></center>

Evaluation is a very important aspect of metacognition. As a college student, there will be many opportunities for you to evaluate yourself – that is, to ask how well you performed something. When students self-evaluate their performance, they may ask themselves, “Am I learning well on this activity?” or “What things did I find challenging?” These types of questions naturally prompt students to think about the strategies that worked well for them and those that were less effective. 

## WHY is evaluation important?

Being an effective evaluator enables students to piece together a puzzle so that they can identify what worked, what did not work, and, hopefully, what needs to be done to improve for next time. By evaluating yourself more frequently, it is likely that you will:

* become more aware of your strengths and weaknesses
* identify specific skills that need to be improved
* develop an understanding of the strategies that are most effective for assignments
* feel confident in the quality of work that you submit

However, when you <b/><u>do <b/>not self-evaluate on a regular basis, some problems can arise. You may:



> Anthony, a first-year college student, just finished taking his first
> History exam of the semester. Often after an exam Anthony thinks to
> himself, “I know how well I did on that exam; I’m content with my
> grade.” He thinks and reflects on the material he learned and is
> confident about having learned all of the necessary material. However,
> he has a set way of studying and does not think about easier or better
> ways to study for different exams and often does not reflect on what
> went well and what didn’t well with studying. Therefore, Anthony
> sometimes feels stuck or overwhelmed when beginning to study for his
> next exam, as he doesn’t really know the best way to study for an
> exam, he only knows one way.

## Why is Evaluation Important?

It is inevitable that you will encounter some challenges while completing your schoolwork. For example:

* you might have difficulty understanding what you read from a textbook
* you may struggle to solve certain types of mathematics problems.
* you may not also be able to clearly express your thoughts in writing

You may also do some things that are not very effective - and you do not even realize that they are ineffective. For example:

* you may use the same types of strategies for all your classes even when other strategies might be more effective.
* you might begin assignments without realizing that you are not doing things correctly

By learning how monitor your learning strategies and skills more frequently, you can avoid these types challenges and become empowered to take control of your schoolwork.

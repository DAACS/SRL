**What does a Metacognitive profile look like as it pertains to college life?What does a Metacognitive profile look like as it pertains to college life?**

The figure below shows the interaction of the three metacognitive components (i.e., planning, monitoring, and evaluation) of a fictional college student, Ryan. Click on the statements below to read about what Ryan was like before using SRL survey feedback and after he began working with this feedback system over time. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle">
> *Ryan is a 40 year old male who recently enrolled in an online college. He is taking classes part-time while he continues his job as a business consultant for a technology company.  After returning home from work at 5:30pm, Ryan typically spends time with his two children (ages 4 and 7), eats dinner with his family, and helps his wife with baths and bedtime. He is only able to start his schoolwork after 8:30pm, when the children are asleep.*

### Ryan’s metacognitive strategy use *BEFORE* using SRL Survey recommendations:

*Ryan is very busy with his family and work responsibilities. He can do his schoolwork and study for his exam after his children go to sleep – about 8:30pm or so. As a student, Ryan did not realize that planning is related to the way in which he engages in self-checking and adapting behaviors. Therefore, with his busy life, he studies when he finds time. As a result, he constantly feels rushed and worries that he just does not have the necessary time to get through all of the study material. Although some of his friends told him that he needs to plan better, Ryan told them that he has no time to plan and that it was a waste of his time. **(Infrequent Planning))**

> Ryan demonstrates a weakness in the frequency with which he plans, which results in confusion and poor time management.

>How would things look if Ryan thought to himself “How much time do I have to complete this? or “How can I
organize myself and my materials?”

As he prepares for his next test, Ryan is fairly adept at noticing when his thoughts wander and when he is getting confused. To keep himself aware of his learning, he tries to stops at the end of each section of the study guide to ask, “Do I understand what I just studied?” Further, in order to check his comprehension during studying, Ryan typically wants to quiz himself. Unfortunately, because he does not really plan out his study sessions he tends to not be able to do all of the things that he thinks he can do. **(Frequent Monitoring)**.

> Ryan’s strength is his ability to monitor his learning. 
> 
> Ryan already thinks to himself “Am I meeting my learning goals?” and “What strategies am I using that are or are not working well to help me learn? What if he also thought “What other resources could I use to complete this task?

Although Ryan does a good job of trying to keep track of his learning during studying, he rarely reflects on how effectively he learns. As soon as Ryan finished studying the day before the test, he felt good because of how hard he was trying. He believed that he would do fine on the test because of how much he studied, and he seemed to be learning things as well. He did not stop to evaluate if he had actually committed the material to memory, or could just recall it in the short term. When Ryan received feedback about his test a week
later, he was shocked and upset. He received a 74. He couldn’t believe it and began to question whether staying in school was even worth it. **(Infrequent Evaluation).** 

> Ryan does not routinely reflect on and evaluate the quality of his study approach.
> 
> How might Ryan’s reaction differ if he asked himself, “What did I do that worked well? What should I change?”

### Ryan’s metacognitive strategy use *AFTER* using SRL SURVEY recommendations:

Upon completing the SRL survey and reviewing the different partsof the feedback, Ryan thought it would be bestto check-in with his advisor to find out more information regarding strategieshe could use. He realized that the frequency with which he engaged inmetacognition could be improved and therefore he needed to learn and usevarious strategies. Ryan gained insight into the fact that the frequency withwhich he plans, monitors, and evaluates his assignments are all related and canaffect his performance on an assignment. Therefore, he began to re-think hisapproach to school. Rather than waiting until the day before the exam to studyhe began to devote small segments of time each night. He also looked thesyllabus and study guide well in advance oftests so that he can figure out what might be the best way to study. He gotsome of these ideas about how to plan from the SRL survey feedback system and reached out tohis advisor to ask some questions about how he might become a better planner.He never realized that by preparing and thinking ahead he would actually becomemore relaxed and confident as a student **(Frequent Planning)**. 

> Ryan contacted his advisor for more infomrtiaon regarding strategies to use.

> Ryan has learned that devoting time to plan an activity can actually save him time. > 
> Ryan used multiple recommendations, “How much time do I have to complete this? How much time do I need?” and “How can I organize myself and my materials?” and “What resources do I have to complete this task.”
 
Although Ryan was a frequent monitor before the SRL survey experience, he has continued to increase the frequency of monitoring by using new strategies he learned from the SRL survey. He not only tries to monitor how well he is learning during studying, he also tries to identify various resources that he can use when completing a task (i.e. internet, textbooks, notes, worksheets). In general, Ryan is becoming more aware of the things that are most challenging for him and developing strategies to keep him on track and from getting stuck while studying. He often keeps track of various strategies used to overcome obstacles while studying, so he does not make the same mistakes and feel ‘stuck’ while studying **(Frequent Monitoring).**

> Ryan realized that despite his strong monitoring skills, he still has room for improvement.
> 
> He tried new recommendations that he previously was unaware of, “What other resources could I use to complete this task? and “What is most challenging about this task? What can I do different at this point to address these challenges?”
  
One of the habits that Ryan has developed is jotting down key points about what he’s learned or short
summaries of each topic after learning. This helps him to more thoroughly check his understanding. Ryan also writes down the strategies he uses to study (note cards, videos, outlining chapters, reading class notes, etc.). Using these evaluation tactics are important because it not only increases his awareness of the things he did to prepare for this tests, he will also have a better sense of what he might need change or adapt do when preparing for the next test **(Partial Evaluating).**

> Ryan has learned some strategies to evaluate his performance after studying and after taking an exam.
> 
> Ryan used the recommendations tool box to guide his evaluating thinking, “How well did I accomplish the goals of the assignment? What did I learn?” and “What did I do that worked well? What should I change?”

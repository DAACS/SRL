### Before beginning the assignment ask yourself...

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#writingbefore1" style="background-color:LightGreen; width:100%; font-size:20px"><b><i>“What am I supposed to learn? What does the instructor want me to take away from this?”</i></b></button>

<div id="writingbefore1" class="collapse">
Do you understand what the assignment is asking you to do? For example, is your paper supposed to be a narrative of your experiences or is it a research paper using peer-reviewed articles?

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#writingbefore2" style="background-color:LightGreen; width:100%; font-size:20px"><b><i>“What do I already know and what would I like to learn?”</i></b></button>

<div id="writingbefore2" class="collapse">
<ol>
<li> <b>BRAINSTORM</b> what you already know about the topic of the assignment. <b>WRITE</b> or verbally state the information from memory.</li>

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#writingbefore3" style="background-color:LightGreen; width:100%; font-size:20px"><b><i>“What are some ways that I can accomplish this task?”</i></b></button>

<div id="writingbefore3" class="collapse">
<b>BRAINSTORM</b> multiple approaches to the assignment. If you have seen this type of assignment before, what strategies worked best for you? Consider approaches such as making an outline to organize your thoughts.

<li> Estimate how long the assignment will take you. Consider the goals of the assignment and different approaches you can take. </li>

### While working on an assignment ask yourself...

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#writingduring1" style="background-color:DarkSalmon; width:100%; font-size:20px"><b><i>“What strategies am I using that are or are not working well to help me learn?”</i></b></button>

<div id="writingduring1" class="collapse">
<b> WHEN</b> you get stuck, <b> ASK</b> yourself "Am I using the best method possible to write this paper? Should I use a different approach?"

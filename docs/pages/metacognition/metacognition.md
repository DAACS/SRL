## WHAT is metacognition?

Have you ever procrastinated on an “easy” assignment only to find out you didn’t have enough time to finish it? (*Planning*) Or read course material then suddenly thought, “What did I just read?” (*Monitoring*). Have you ever finished a test and thought “I did pretty well!” only to receive a lower grade than you’d expected (*Evaluation*)? Skills in planning, monitoring, and evaluating your schoolwork are called **metacognition**. Metacognition is your awareness of and control over your thinking. These skills are important because they help people stay aware of and take control over how they approach and reflect on their learning.

Metacognition is a loop; it repeats over and over again. You plan before a task, monitor during a task, and evaluate after a task. You can use these skills together when solving an individual math problem, and then again after completing the entire math worksheet.
Your metacognitive skills may all be equally developed, or you may use one strategy (e.g., planning) more frequently than the other two (e.g., monitoring and evaluation), as you can see in the figure above. How frequently you use your metacognitive skills can also vary from task to task. For example, you may frequently create a plan to study for a test, but not develop a plan for writing a paper. To find out more about your metacognitive skills, you can take the <a href="https://demo.daacs.net/">SRL survey</a>.

## WHY is metacognition important?

Frequent use of metacognitive skills is important to being a successful learner! The more you are able to take control of your thinking, the better you will be able to understand things more deeply, remember them longer, and do better in school. Improving these skills will also help you find that you can reflect on the appropriateness of learning strategies and adjust as needed.

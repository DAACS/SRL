Making changes to the way you plan, monitor, and evaluate your thinking during learning activities in college can have a great impact on your academic, emotional, and personal well-being. Click on **Writing**, **Studying**, or **Reading** below to learn how you can improve the way you approach, complete, and reflect on these types of learning activities. 

**What can I do when writing a paper or completing an assignment?** 

  When do I use this strategy?
  
  
  Ask yourself…
  
  
  Explanation of the strategy
  
 
 
  
  Before beginning an assignment
  
  
  “What am I supposed to learn? What does the instructor want me to take away from
  this?”
  
  
  Do you understand what the assignment is asking you to do? For
  example, is your paper supposed to be a narrative of your experiences or is
  it a research paper using peer-reviewed articles? 
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  “What do I already know and
  what would I like to learn?”
  
  
  1.     
  BRAINSTORM
  what you already know about the topic of the assignment. WRITE down or verbally state the information from memory.
  2.     
  ASK
  yourself “What do I want to learn? What skills would I like to take away from
  this assignment?” 
  3.     
  WRITE
  down these goals so that you can refer to them later.
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  “What are some ways that I can
  accomplish this task?”
  
  
  BRAINSTORM multiple
  approaches to the assignment. If you have seen this type of assignment
  before, what strategies worked best for you? Consider approaches such as
  making an outline to organize your thoughts.
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  “How much time do I have to
  complete this? How much time do I need?” 
   
  
  
  1.     
  Start several days in advance.
  2.     
  Estimate how long the assignment will take
  you. Consider the goals of the assignment and different approaches you can
  take. 
  3.     
  Set aside regular times to work and set
  specific goals for each time period. Plan in extra time for certain
  approaches, such as writing an outline before writing a paper.
  4.     
  Try to identify the types of things you do to
  procrastinate, and eliminate one type at a time.

  Time Management page***
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  “How can I organize myself and
  my materials?”
  
  
  1.     
  Collect related course materials before
  beginning an assignment. Keep course materials in a binder and make sure you
  have class work from each class.
  2.     
  If you feel overwhelmed by the material, use a
  graphic organizer or flow chart to connect your thoughts and course material.
  Re-writing the material can help you organize content.
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  “What resources do I have to
  complete the task?”
  
  
  Resources:
  -         
  Textbooks
  -         
  Course lessons
  -         
  Teachers
  -         
  Classmates
   
  When writing a paper, it may be useful to consult multiple sources on
  a topic (e.g., your class notes, textbook, and classmates) to ensure you have
  all the necessary information before writing about it. 
   
  See ***Link to Help Seeking*** in order to learn more about
  approaching teachers and classmates.
  
 
 
  
  When do I use this strategy?
  
  
  Ask yourself…
  
  
  Explanation of the strategy
  
 
 
  
  While working on an assignment
  
  
  “What strategies am I using
  that are or are not working well to help me learn?” 
  
  
  WHEN you get stuck, ASK yourself “Am I using the best
  method possible to write this paper? Should I use a different approach?”
   
  For example, if using an outline did not help, you can organize your
  thoughts in a flow chart or other graphic organizer.

  (e.g., making an outline), click here ***link to learning strategies overview
  page***
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  “What other resources could I
  use to complete this task?” 
  
  
  Resources:
  -         
  Textbooks
  -         
  Course lessons
  -         
  Teachers
  -         
  Classmates
   
  WHEN you get stuck, ASK yourself “Am I using all of these
  resources? Is there one I could use better?”
   
  See ***Link to Help Seeking*** in order to learn more about
  approaching teachers and classmates. 
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  “What is most challenging about
  this task? What can I do differently at this point to address these
  challenges?”
  
  
  ASK yourself “What am I
  having trouble with?” so you know where to pay more attention. BRAINSTORM ways to overcome these
  challenges instead of continuing to run into the same obstacles. Seek help if
  you cannot find a solution on your own or before you start another assignment
  of the same type.

  “Am I meeting my learning
  goals?”
   
  
  
  ASK yourself “Does what
  you have written for this assignment match the criteria for the assignment?
  Am I focusing on areas or topics where I want to learn more? If not, where
  did I diverge from my goals and how can I get back on track?”
  
 
 
  
  When do I use this strategy?
  
  
  Ask yourself…
  
  
  Explanation of the strategy
  
 
 
  
  After completing an assignment
  
  
  “How well did I accomplish the
  goals of the assignment? What did I learn?” 
  
  
  1.     
  ASK
  yourself “Did I accomplish the assignment’s goals? Did I learn what I set out
  to?”
  2.     
  If your answer is “No” try to meet your goals
  before submitting the assignment. Also, make note of the topics you still
  have to learn and revisit these in the future. You can also reach out to your
  professor or use other resources to accomplish these goals.

   “What did I do that worked well? What should
  I change” 
   
  
  
  1.     
  ASK
  yourself “Did one learning strategy work better than others?”
  2.     
  ASK yourself
  “Did I perform better on one part of the assignment than others?” Maybe your
  outline was great, but the written paper was not your highest quality work. 
  3.     
  WRITE
  down effective strategies and areas for improvements. You can also write a
  reminder on a calendar to return to this list the next time you have a
  similar assignment.
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  “What topics am I still
  confused about that I need to clarify? How can I get my questions answered?”
  
   
   
  
  
  1.     
  Recognize concepts you still need to master –
  it is likely that these concepts will come up again throughout the course of
  your education.
  2.     
  Use your resources (e.g., ask a teacher, read
  the textbook) to clarify confusions before attempting another assignment of
  this type.
